WayVNC (Wayland-Compatible VNC Server)
wayvnc is a lightweight VNC server designed specifically for Wayland compositors like GNOME’s Mutter (used in Ubuntu 24.04). It’s perfect for remote access to a Wayland session on your Raspberry Pi 5.

Why It’s Great: Lightweight, built for Wayland, works with any VNC viewer (e.g., TigerVNC, Remmina).
